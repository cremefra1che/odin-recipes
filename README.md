# odin-recipes
Project: Recipes from www.theodinproject.com by cremefraiche

This is a project for learning HTML. I will be making a basic recipe website consisting of an index page, with links to some recipes.

To make this I will have to make use of links and ordered (and maybe some unordered) tables for displaying the recipes in a sensible manner.

By completion of this project I hope to have gained better understanding of the use of Git, and GitHub.
