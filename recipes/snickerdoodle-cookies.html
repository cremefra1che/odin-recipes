            <li>1 ½ teaspoons baking powder </li>
            <li>¼ teaspoon baking soda </li>

            <li>3 tablespoons real maple syrup </li>
            <li>1 egg </li>
            <li>½ cup white sugar </li>
            <li>¼ cup maple sugar </li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Stir together the flour, baking powder, baking soda, and cinnamon. Set aside.</li>
            <li>In a large bowl, cream together the margarine and 1 cup of white sugar until light and fluffy. Beat in the egg and maple syrup. Gradually blend in the dry ingredients until just mixed. In a small dish, mix together the remaining 1/2 cup white sugar and the maple sugar. Roll dough into 1 inch balls, and roll the balls in the sugar mixture. Place cookies 2 inches apart on ungreased cookie sheets.</li>
            <li>Bake 8 to 10 minutes in the preheated oven. Cookies will be crackly on top and look wet in the middle. Remove from cookie sheets to cool on wire racks.</li>
        </ol>
